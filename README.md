Android Webview Tester
======================

An Android App to test html in the Android Webview.

If you've ever had the need to create HTML that is to be rendered in an Android webview then there are issues to overcome when developing.
The main issue is that testing your code in the Chrome for Android or Android web browser does not reflect how the code will react in the Android Webview as it is a different browser with it's own set of issues.

This app aims to help development of HTML that is to be deployed to an Android webview.

It features a full screen webview with a very basic address bar that can be updated to load in new content or refreshed once changes have been made.
Another useful feature is a qr code reader for easy input of complicated dev urls.
If it is running on a device with Android 4.4 or higher then the webview can be debugged in Desktop Chrome once connected to the machine over USB.
